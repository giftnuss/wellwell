We don't pay any heed to backward compatibility for Wellwell until
it is announced as stable and mature enough.

Wellwell is a composition framework for Interchange. 

It's main difference from previous IC demo catalogs that it doesn't tend to be a demo, but rather a frame for building new catalogs. 

It's main building blocks are components, assembled together with [compose] called from within pages.

Flaws in Standard / Interchange
*******************************

* two shopping carts components  to maintain

Goals
*****

* No stone will be left unturned.
* KISS instead of convoluted ITL code in standard and predecessors.
* Death of [process] (almost done).
* Supersede Interchange's routes and profiles with form framework.
* Keep core of WellWell small, use plugins for extended functionality.

In consequence this deprecates the following tags in this scope:
[button], [image].

Prerequisites
*************

Interchange 5.7.1 and at least:
	Dispatch.pm 1.103
	Order.pm 2.104

Users
*****

By default, Wellwell comes with two user roles:

    * Anonymous user: this role is used for users that don't have a user account or that are not authenticated.
    * Authenticated user: this role is automatically granted to all logged in users.

Automatic components/attributes
*******************************

MV_COMPONENT_AUTO
MV_ATTRIBUTE_AUTO

Forms
*****

Template
--------

Forms are build from templates as well. The default template is located at:

templates/form

Alternative templates can be specified in table form_series, field
template.

Attributes
----------

Every form element can have a set of attributes, stored in the form_attributes
table. They are working pretty much the same as in the metadata table for the
Interchange UI.

Attributes can be applied for every form element with a certain name:

wellwell=> select * from form_attributes where name = 'country';
 code |  name   | component |  attribute   |                           value                            
------+---------+-----------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------
   32 | country |           | lookup_query | SELECT code,name FROM country ORDER BY priority DESC, name

Or only for a certain from:

wellwell=> select * from form_attributes where component = 'content_edit';
 code | name |  component   | attribute | value 
------+------+--------------+-----------+-------
   30 | uri  | content_edit | width     | 200
   31 | body | content_edit | height    | 400

Plugins
*******

Plugins are living in the plugins subdirectory of wellwell.

Plugins are activated by adding them to PLUGINS variable
(comma separated list of plugins).

Please read the README for the plugin first and follow the
instructions before activating the plugin.

Paging
******

Paging can be controlled by passing parameters to [searchcontainer].

paging_startlinks => always show # links at the beginning
paging_endlinks => always show # links at the end
paging_slidelength => length of sliding window

Example:
96 pages, startlinks 3, endlinks 1, slidelength 5

page 1 shows: 1,2,3,4,5,..,96
page 8 shows: 1,2,3,..,6,7,8,9,10,..,96

Processing
**********

1. Autoload
Autoload checks for form submissions so we can reroute the request based on
certain conditions.

Routes
******

More flexible routes needs modifications to Interchange itself, but here we go:

- complementing record files with record macros

Modules for Composition Framework
*********************************

Vend::Compose::Address => addresses, [address]
Vend::Compose::Taxonomy

Features
********

- deal gracefully with discontinued items (through order_missing SpecialSub)
