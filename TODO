*  Document [compose] and [action] the XMLDOCS way

*  [compose] should support more aliases

*  Find improvements for templating. 
   Currenty if you put {NAME} inside a template you have to define 
   a component to link to this inside the page. It should be possible 
   to call something by default for all pages so you can have ie. 
   same menu or same header on all pages without writing it in 
   every page (main point of templates).

*  Determine location to hold email templates,... 
   * templates/email would work if direct inclusion of components would work (too hard to edit for customers?)

*  Enable direct inclusion of components into templates (without compose)

*  Action Tag: it should be possible to assign attributes to targets

*  Enable RT Queue 'wellwell'

* Make prefix/suffix in display_menu configurable

* Gettext support, possibly with strings in the database

* Alias [comment] to [c] and support [l bla bla /] (if not yet supported)
  in addition to the usual [l]bla bla[/l]
