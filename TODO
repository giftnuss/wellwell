*  Document [compose] and [action] the XMLDOCS way

*  [compose] should support more aliases

*  Find improvements for templating. 
   Currenty if you put {NAME} inside a template you have to define 
   a component to link to this inside the page. It should be possible 
   to call something by default for all pages so you can have ie. 
   same menu or same header on all pages without writing it in 
   every page (main point of templates).
