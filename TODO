*  Document [compose] the XMLDOCS way

*  [compose] should support more aliases

*  Determine location to hold email templates,... 
   * templates/email would work if direct inclusion of components would work (too hard to edit for customers?)

*  Enable direct inclusion of components into templates (without compose)

*  Action Tag: it should be possible to assign attributes to targets

* Gettext support, possibly with strings in the database

* Support [l bla bla /] (if not yet supported)
  in addition to the usual [l]bla bla[/l]
